markdown-here-css
=================

the file `default.css` should go in "primary styling"
also, markdown-here periodically updates their css to be more cross-browser compatible, and my css isn't getting those updates - you may want to pick out the parts of this you like into theirs :)

Also, this is primarily targeted at gmail users (like the students at Yale university). The rounded-borders headers that look so seek don't work in every email client.
