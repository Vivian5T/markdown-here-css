markdown-here-css
=================

the file `default.css` should go in "primary styling"
Markdown-here periodically updates their css to be more cross-browser compatible, and my css isn't getting those updates. I like to put my overrides at the bottom of their default styling, but there may be conflicts - double-check it looks how you'd like before sending :)

If something looks funny, try their default first and then try these additions one at a time.

This css is primarily targeted at gmail users (like the students at Yale university). The rounded-borders headers that look so sleek don't work in every email client.
